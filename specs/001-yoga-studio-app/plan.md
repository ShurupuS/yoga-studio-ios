## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Components

#### ViewModels
- `AuthenticationViewModel`: Handles login/register logic
- `ClassListViewModel`: Manages class browsing and filtering
- `BookingViewModel`: Handles booking creation and management
- `ProfileViewModel`: Manages user profile operations
- `AdminDashboardViewModel`: Handles admin operations

#### Services
- `AuthenticationService`: User authentication and authorization
- `ClassService`: Class CRUD operations and scheduling
- `BookingService`: Booking management and availability
- `PaymentService`: Payment processing and history
- `NotificationService`: Push notifications and messaging

#### Data Layer
- `CoreDataStack`: Core Data setup and configuration
- `UserRepository`: User data access and persistence
- `ClassRepository`: Class data management
- `BookingRepository`: Booking data operations
- `NetworkManager`: API communication and error handling

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: Use `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` for ViewModels
2. **Navigation**: Implement NavigationStack for iOS 16+ compatibility
3. **Data Persistence**: Core Data with CloudKit for sync
4. **Networking**: URLSession with async/await and proper error handling
5. **UI Framework**: Pure SwiftUI with custom components
6. **Testing**: XCTest for unit tests, XCUITest for UI tests

### Dependencies
- Core Data (built-in)
- CloudKit (built-in)
- StoreKit (for payments)
- UserNotifications (for push notifications)
- LocalAuthentication (for biometric auth)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Core Data Migration**: Plan for schema changes with proper migration
- **API Reliability**: Implement robust error handling and retry logic
- **Performance**: Monitor memory usage and optimize queries
- **Security**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Implement user onboarding and help system
- **Payment Processing**: Ensure PCI compliance and secure handling
- **Scalability**: Design for future growth and feature additions
- **Competition**: Focus on unique value propositions
