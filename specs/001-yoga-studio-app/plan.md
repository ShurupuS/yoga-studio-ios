## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Components

#### ViewModels
- `AuthenticationViewModel`: Handles studio owner login/register logic
- `DashboardViewModel`: Manages dashboard overview and analytics
- `ClassListViewModel`: Manages class browsing and filtering
- `MemberListViewModel`: Manages member list and details
- `SubscriptionViewModel`: Manages subscription plans and member subscriptions
- `BookingViewModel`: Handles booking management and tracking
- `AnalyticsViewModel`: Handles analytics and reporting

#### Services
- `AuthenticationService`: Studio owner authentication and authorization
- `MemberService`: Member management and operations
- `ClassService`: Class CRUD operations and scheduling
- `SubscriptionService`: Subscription management and billing
- `BookingService`: Booking management and tracking
- `PaymentService`: Payment processing and history
- `NotificationService`: Push notifications and messaging
- `AnalyticsService`: Analytics and reporting

#### Data Layer
- `CoreDataStack`: Core Data setup and configuration
- `StudioOwnerRepository`: Studio owner data access and persistence
- `MemberRepository`: Member data access and persistence
- `ClassRepository`: Class data management
- `SubscriptionRepository`: Subscription data operations
- `BookingRepository`: Booking data operations
- `PaymentRepository`: Payment data operations
- `NetworkManager`: API communication and error handling

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: Use `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` for ViewModels
2. **Navigation**: Implement NavigationStack for iOS 16+ compatibility
3. **Data Persistence**: Core Data with CloudKit for sync
4. **Networking**: URLSession with async/await and proper error handling
5. **UI Framework**: Pure SwiftUI with custom components
6. **Testing**: XCTest for unit tests, XCUITest for UI tests

### Dependencies
- Core Data (built-in)
- CloudKit (built-in)
- StoreKit (for payments)
- UserNotifications (for push notifications)
- LocalAuthentication (for biometric auth)
