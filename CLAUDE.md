## Current Development Focus

### Active Branch: `dev`
- All development happens in the `dev` branch
- Stable releases go to `main` branch
- Offline-first architecture implementation

### Immediate Tasks (User Story 1: Project Setup)
- [ ] Create MVVM folder structure in Xcode project
- [ ] Set up SwiftData ModelContainer configuration
- [ ] Create SwiftDataContainer.swift with proper configuration
- [ ] Implement DependencyInjection container
- [ ] Create NetworkManager.swift with URLSession
- [ ] Set up Error handling system with custom Error types
- [ ] Configure logging system

### Key Files to Create First
- `yoga-studio-app/Data/SwiftDataContainer.swift`
- `yoga-studio-app/Utils/NetworkManager.swift`
- `yoga-studio-app/Utils/DependencyInjection.swift`
- `yoga-studio-app/Utils/Logger.swift`

## Quick Start

### 1. Review the Constitution
Read `memory/constitution.md` to understand the core principles and constraints for this project.

### 2. Understand the Specification
Review `specs/001-yoga-studio-app/spec.md` for detailed requirements and user stories.

### 3. Follow the Implementation Plan
Use `specs/001-yoga-studio-app/plan.md` as a roadmap for development phases.

### 4. Execute Tasks
Follow `specs/001-yoga-studio-app/tasks.md` for specific implementation tasks.

## Available Commands

### Spec-Kit Commands
- `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plan from specification
- `/speckit.tasks` - Generate task breakdown from plan
- `/speckit.implement` - Execute implementation tasks
- `/speckit.checklist` - Validate implementation against specification

### Development Commands
- `/speckit.analyze` - Analyze current codebase against spec
- `/speckit.clarify` - Get clarification on specification details

## Project Status

### Current Phase: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Offline-First)
- [x] Spec-Kit setup and configuration
- [x] Constitution definition
- [x] Specification creation with offline-first architecture
- [x] Implementation plan with SwiftData
- [x] Task breakdown with offline priorities
- [x] Offline-first architecture guide
- [x] Dev branch created and configured
- [ ] Project architecture setup (MVVM + SwiftData)
- [ ] SwiftData ModelContainer configuration
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Offline sync preparation

### Next Steps (Phase 1: Foundation)
1. Set up MVVM architecture in Xcode project
2. Configure SwiftData ModelContainer for offline-first storage
3. Implement authentication system
4. Create SwiftData models with sync metadata
5. Add offline indicators and sync preparation

## Key Principles

### From Constitution
- **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive and accessible interface
- **Technical Excellence**: SwiftUI, MVVM, SwiftData, comprehensive testing
- **Performance & Reliability**: Smooth animations, offline-first capability
- **Security & Privacy**: Secure authentication, data protection
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture, future-ready design

### Offline-First Principles
- **Local Data Priority**: All data stored locally first using SwiftData
- **Immediate Responsiveness**: UI responds instantly to user actions
- **Eventual Consistency**: Sync with backend when available
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merge strategies for data conflicts
- **Future-Proof**: Easy backend integration when ready

### Development Standards
- Follow Swift style guidelines
- Write comprehensive tests
- Maintain high code quality
- Document complex logic
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Success Metrics
- App store rating above 4.5 stars
- User retention rate above 70%
- Crash rate below 0.1%
- App launch time under 2 seconds
- Smooth animations and responsive UI

## Getting Help
