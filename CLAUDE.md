```

## Quick Start

### 1. Review the Constitution
Read `memory/constitution.md` to understand the core principles and constraints for this project.

### 2. Understand the Specification
Review `specs/001-yoga-studio-app/spec.md` for detailed requirements and user stories.

### 3. Follow the Implementation Plan
Use `specs/001-yoga-studio-app/plan.md` as a roadmap for development phases.

### 4. Execute Tasks
Follow `specs/001-yoga-studio-app/tasks.md` for specific implementation tasks.

## Available Commands

### Spec-Kit Commands
- `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plan from specification
- `/speckit.tasks` - Generate task breakdown from plan
- `/speckit.implement` - Execute implementation tasks
- `/speckit.checklist` - Validate implementation against specification

### Development Commands
- `/speckit.analyze` - Analyze current codebase against spec
- `/speckit.clarify` - Get clarification on specification details

## Project Status

### Current Phase: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- [x] Spec-Kit setup and configuration
- [x] Constitution definition
- [x] Specification creation
- [x] Implementation plan
- [x] Task breakdown
- [ ] Project architecture setup
- [ ] Core Data configuration
- [ ] Authentication system

### Next Steps
1. Set up MVVM architecture in Xcode project
2. Configure Core Data stack
3. Implement authentication system
4. Create basic data models

## Key Principles

### From Constitution
- **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive and accessible interface
- **Technical Excellence**: SwiftUI, MVVM, comprehensive testing
- **Performance & Reliability**: Smooth animations, offline capability
- **Security & Privacy**: Secure authentication, data protection
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture, future-ready design

### Development Standards
- Follow Swift style guidelines
- Write comprehensive tests
- Maintain high code quality
- Document complex logic
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Success Metrics
- App store rating above 4.5 stars
- User retention rate above 70%
- Crash rate below 0.1%
- App launch time under 2 seconds
- Smooth animations and responsive UI
